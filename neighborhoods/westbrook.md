Westbrook is one of Night City's most affluent district. It's a stark contrast to the gritty realities found in many other parts of the city, characterized by luxurious high-rises, exclusive clubs, high-end boutiques, and pristine streets. Life here is generally safer and more comfortable than elsewhere, but even in Westbrook, the undercurrents of Night City's power struggles and social stratification are never far beneath the surface.

While the Tyger Claws don't control the Westbrook district, they are by far the most prominent in the area.

## Club Mox

Club Mox is a prominent and unique establishment located in Westbrook's Japantown, a district renowned for its vibrant nightlife and entertainment. However, Club Mox stands out due to its specific origins and the philosophy it embodies, as a sanctuary and a tribute to a specific subculture within Night City.

Club Mox was founded by Judy Alvarez and the Mox gang, a group that emerged from the aftermath of Lizzie Wizzy's murder. The Mox are not a typical gang driven by territory or power; instead, they are protectors of the downtrodden, the victims of abuse, and those who have been exploited. Their motto, "We protect those who have no one to protect them," is central to their identity and the atmosphere of their club.
