The "Night City Estates" region of Night City, often more specifically referred to as North Oak, represents the pinnacle of luxury and exclusivity within the megalopolis. This is where Night City's truly wealthy elite reside: corpo executives, venture capitalists, famous musicians, and actors. Unlike the dense, vertical sprawl of other districts, North Oak is characterized by spacious, sprawling villas, manicured lawns, and private estates, offering a sense of privacy and tranquility rarely found elsewhere in the city.

The air in Night City Estates is noticeably cleaner, the noise levels significantly lower, and the streets are impeccably maintained. Security here is paramount, with private corporate security forces and advanced surveillance systems ensuring the safety and discretion of its high-profile residents. It's a secluded "utopia" for those who can afford it, designed to shield its inhabitants from the rampant crime, poverty, and pollution that plague much of the rest of Night City. The architecture often blends futuristic designs with classic luxury, featuring impressive facades, automated gates, and lush, sometimes even micro-climate-controlled, gardens.

## Moon Mansion

The Moon Mansion is the official residence of Night City's mayor. As such, it stands as a symbol of the city's political power and the aspirations of its leadership. While its exact location is a closely guarded secret for security reasons, it is understood to be situated within the highly exclusive and heavily fortified confines of North Oak in Westbrook.

The mansion itself is an architectural marvel, a testament to modern luxury and defensive design. In essence, Moon Mansion is a fortress of political authority nestled within Night City's most exclusive enclave, embodying the often-hidden power dynamics at play in the "City of Dreams."
