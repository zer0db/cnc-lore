# City Center

The beating heart of Night City, and a testament to corporate power and relentless reconstruction. Characterized by towering skyscrapers and neon lights, it serves as the main commercial district and a playground for the city's wealthiest residents. The City Center is divided into two sub-districts.

## Corpo Plaza

Corpo Plaza is the literal and metaphorical center of corporate power in Night City. It's an imposing landscape dominated by gargantuan skyscrapers and megabuildings that serve as the headquarters for some of the world's most powerful megacorporations, including the infamous Arasaka and Militech. The architecture here is a striking display of neo-militarism, with buildings that look as much like fortified emplacements as they do offices: aggressive, domineering, and a constant reminder of who truly holds sway in Night City.

Corpo Plaza is a heavily secured area. NCPD and corporate security forces patrol relentlessly, and multiple checkpoints control access to buildings, ensuring the safety of corporate assets and personnel. The streets are always crowded with low and mid-level corpos rushing between meetings, while armored AVs carrying high-ranking executives glide through the sky. Despite the superficial appearance of peace, the pervasive security underscores the constant tensions and underlying power struggles within this corporate-controlled zone.

## Downtown

Downtown is where the City Center lets its hair down, offering a more vibrant and, at times, seedy contrast to the rigid formality of Corpo Plaza. Rebuilt extensively after the nuclear incident, Downtown is now a hub for extravagant hotels, delectable restaurants, and exclusive nightclubs. It's designed as a playground for the wealthy, offering countless reasons to visit for entertainment and leisure.

While generally considered "safe" by the NCPD compared to more dangerous districts, Downtown's attractions draw in all sorts of characters, including members of various gangs from other districts who often assume roles as bouncers and bodyguards. This influx creates a dynamic environment where the veneer of luxury can quickly dissolve into the grittier realities of Night City's underworld.
