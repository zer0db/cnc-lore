# Pacifica

Pacifica is one of Night City's most distinctive and troubled districts, a stark contrast to the gleaming corporate towers of City Center. Originally envisioned as a luxurious tourist resort, the district's development was halted mid-way, leaving behind a half-finished dream and a landscape dominated by crumbling infrastructure and abandoned projects. It's now primarily inhabited by the Haitian immigrant community, who sought refuge in Night City and have largely carved out their own society within Pacifica's neglected bounds. This isolation has led to a strong sense of community but also made Pacifica a hotspot for criminal activity, particularly the Voodoo Boys gang, who exert significant control over the area.

The Industrial Zone on the east side of Pacifica is controlled by the Maelstrom, while the west side including the Beach and Circus Grounds is controlled by the Voodoo Boys.

## Beach

The Beach in Pacifica is a far cry from the idyllic, sun-kissed shores one might imagine. It's largely a desolate and unkempt stretch of coastline, reflecting the district's overall state of abandonment. The development never fully materialized here, leaving behind rusting boardwalks, half-built piers, and the skeletal remains of what were meant to be grand tourist attractions. The sand is often littered with debris, and the once-promising ocean views are frequently obscured by the hazy, polluted air of Night City.

Right beside the beach is a long stretch of well-maintained blacktop known as the Night City Racing Strip (or just 'the Strip' if you're a local). This area is frequented by speed demons, stunt drivers, their fanbases, and race organizers looking to make a quick buck.

## Circus Grounds

The Night City Circus Grounds is perhaps the most iconic symbol of Pacifica's unfulfilled potential. The grand hall of Circus Grounds' cathedral has been converted into a communal space and the main base of operations for the Voodoo Boys. Graffiti covers almost every surface, and the air is thick with the scent of spices and the hum of repurposed tech. Entering this area without the Voodoo Boys' blessing is extremely perilous, as they fiercely protect their territory and their secrets within its crumbling walls.

## Industrial Zone

While not as prominent as other industrial zones in Night City, Pacifica does have an underdeveloped and largely derelict industrial area. This zone was likely intended to support the tourist infrastructure with power plants, waste disposal facilities, and logistical hubs, but like the rest of the district, its development was halted. What remains are abandoned warehouses, rusting machinery, and overgrown lots.

These decaying industrial structures have become havens for the less fortunate, providing makeshift shelters for squatters and serving as discreet locations for illegal activities. The Voodoo Boys also utilize parts of this zone for their own purposes, often for less visible operations, data storage, or as temporary hideouts. The atmosphere here is bleak and grimy, characterized by the metallic tang of rust and the eerie silence of disused factories, broken only by the occasional scuttle of scavengers or the distant sounds of the struggling community in other parts of Pacifica.
