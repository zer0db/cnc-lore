> The Arasaka Corporation is the longest-operating megacorp in the world. Its origins date back to the mid-20th century when a young Saburo Arasaka inherited his father's nascent company, transforming it into a global leader in security. Today, the Arasaka Corporation is known as an arms-manufacturing giant that has had its hands in military conflicts across all continents. Due to the latest advances in technology and the company's seemingly unlimited capital, Arasaka is poised to achieve its political goals on a massive scale. Arasaka's soldiers and agents are known not only for their excellent training, but also for their steadfast loyalty to corporate values and CEO.

Arasaka Corporation is one of the most influential megacorporations in the world, offering services in corporate security and elite banking. It rules Night City with the sleek, ultra-sharp, high-tech facade which is far cleaner than its blood-soaked undercurrent of ‘off-the-books operations’, carried out by ruthless agents and mercenaries.

> Militech International Armaments is one of the largest, most powerful corporations in the world. Known mainly in the ISA for their support of the federal government, they provide both manpower and arms to the regime, including weapons and specialist military gear. Militech's contract for the ISA is controversial in some political circles: Militech has been accused of attempting to create a monopoly, while the clear connections between former Militech CEO and current ISA president Rosalind Myers and the corporation's board have only exacerbated corporate and diplomatic tensions. Militech also operates in the private sector, providing security as well as defensive and offensive combat services. The corporation offers clients the latest equipment, skilled staff and trained, well-equipped agents to get the job done. In addition, the megacorp also develops and produces its own firearms, drones, implants, even vehicles suitable for land, air and sea combat.

One of the world’s most prominent suppliers of top-shelf military weapons, vehicles, and equipment. Arasaka’s main rival. Militech operates on a global scale, making no distinction between clients, and operating defense, peace-keeping, and nation-building missions through its network of private military contractors.
