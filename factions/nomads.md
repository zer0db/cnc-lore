# Nomad Families

## Aldecaldos

> When gang violence claimed the life of Juan Aldecaldo’s son, the grieving father’s impassioned protests became a beacon for many outraged migrants in Los Angeles. They formed a family around him, and split away, taking to the road and adopting the nomad lifestyle. Elder Aldecaldo passed on in later years, and now the Aldecaldos find themselves camped in the deserts near Night City. Their RVs-cum mobile-workshops, souped-up-cars, and their proficiency for covert scavenging have allowed them to carve a life on the outskirts of the city, where they transport and smuggle goods for whoever is willing to pay.

The Aldelcaldos, the first true Nomad Family that was established in 1990s as Los Angeles turned into a war zone. 
- Estimated Gang Size: 500 - 600 in Night City.
- Turf: Outskirts of Night City

## Wraiths

> Wraiths are a motley crew of those exiled from other nomad groups for violating customs, and for other transgressions. While most nomad families live on the edge of the law, Wraiths plant themselves firmly outside of it, eschewing the ‘folksy warmth’ aesthetic familiar to true nomad groups. They raid convoys with modded guns and missile launchers, adorn themselves in black and blue shades, evoking ethereal, ghostly imagery, and while to city dwellers they’re just another nomadic tribe, Wraiths are more akin to outright mercs—who just happen to share nomadic roots.

The Wraiths is one of the distinguished gangs of the Nomad groups who inhabit the badlands. This gang has a long history of frequent conflict and warring with the Aldecaldos, what sets them apart is that they travel mostly at night and prey on their foes while they are sleeping and unaware.
- Estimated Gang Size: 300 - 1200
- Turf: Outskirts of Night City
