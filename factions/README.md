# Factions

The factions of Night City are broken down into three categories: megacorporations, gangs, and nomad families.


## [Megacorporations](/factions/megacorps.md)

Megacorporations are powerful conglomerates of corporations. Due to the failing U.S. Government, it had to rely on several megacorps to survive. This has given them the capability to operate as they will. This included the repeal of important anti-trust, worker/consumer protection, and environmental protection laws.


## [Gangs](/factions/gangs.md)

From technology-obsessed fully cybered gangs, combat obsessive warrior "tribes," and even gangs centered around cults, there is a diverse array of Gangs in Night City in 2077. These ferocious beasts are not to be trifled with without impunity.


## [Nomad Families](/factions/nomads.md)

Nomads were once corporate wage-slaves, who got fired and blackballed from employment, and now they roam the highways as travellers and motor-gangs. As life on the road is hard, they maintain strong family bonds. If a Nomad is in trouble, he can count on members of his family to watch his back.
