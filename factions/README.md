# Factions

The factions of Night City are broken down into three categories: megacorporations, gangs, and nomad families.

## Megacorporations

Megacorporations are powerful conglomerates of corporations. Due to the failing U.S. Government, it had to rely on several megacorps to survive. This has given them the capability to operate as they will. This included the repeal of important anti-trust, worker/consumer protection, and environmental protection laws.

### Arasaka

![Arasaka logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zer0db/cnc-lore/refs/heads/main/factions/images/arasaka.png)

> The Arasaka Corporation is the longest-operating megacorp in the world. Its origins date back to the mid-20th century when a young Saburo Arasaka inherited his father's nascent company, transforming it into a global leader in security. Today, the Arasaka Corporation is known as an arms-manufacturing giant that has had its hands in military conflicts across all continents. Due to the latest advances in technology and the company's seemingly unlimited capital, Arasaka is poised to achieve its political goals on a massive scale. Arasaka's soldiers and agents are known not only for their excellent training, but also for their steadfast loyalty to corporate values and CEO.

Arasaka Corporation is one of the most influential megacorporations in the world, offering services in corporate security and elite banking. It rules Night City with the sleek, ultra-sharp, high-tech facade which is far cleaner than its blood-soaked undercurrent of ‘off-the-books operations’, carried out by ruthless agents and mercenaries.
- Founded: late 1800s - early 1900s
- Corporation Value: 890 billion Eurodollars
- Estimated Employees: Over 595,000


### Militech

![Militech logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zer0db/cnc-lore/refs/heads/main/factions/images/militech.png)
> Militech International Armaments is one of the largest, most powerful corporations in the world. Known mainly in the NUSA for their support of the federal government, they provide both manpower and arms to the regime, including weapons and specialist military gear. Militech's contract for the NUSA is controversial in some political circles: Militech has been accused of attempting to create a monopoly, while the clear connections between former Militech CEO and current NUSA president Rosalind Myers and the corporation's board have only exacerbated corporate and diplomatic tensions. Militech also operates in the private sector, providing security as well as defensive and offensive combat services. The corporation offers clients the latest equipment, skilled staff and trained, well-equipped agents to get the job done. In addition, the megacorp also develops and produces its own firearms, drones, implants, even vehicles suitable for land, air and sea combat.

One of the world’s most prominent suppliers of top-shelf military weapons, vehicles, and equipment. Arasaka’s main rival. Militech operates on a global scale, making no distinction between clients, and operating defense, peace-keeping, and nation-building missions through its network of private military contractors.
- Founded: 1996
- Corporation Value: 1.2 Trillion Eurodollars
- Estimated Employees: Over 647,500


### Kang-Tao

![Kang-Tao logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zer0db/cnc-lore/refs/heads/main/factions/images/kangtao.png)
> Kang Tao is a Chinese company and one of the world's largest weapons manufacturers. For years now, Kang Tao has increasingly become a worthy competitor for Arasaka by introducing some of the most bleeding-edge technology the market has ever seen. The megacorp consistently surpasses client expectations for quality weapons and equipment that suits both military and paramilitary needs. But most notably, Kang Tao is widely recognized for its specialization in the development, patenting and production of Smart-class weaponry and weapon systems. In this niche market, they are without equal

- Founded: 2050
- Corporation Value: 525 Billion Eurodollars
- Estimated Employees: 1,000,000


## Gangs

From technology-obsessed fully cybered gangs, combat obsessive warrior "tribes," and even gangs centered around cults, there is a diverse array of Gangs in Night City in 2077. These ferocious beasts are not to be trifled with without impunity.

### 6th Street

![6th Street logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zer0db/cnc-lore/refs/heads/main/factions/images/6street.png)
> 6th Street started out as the good guys; a force that would stand up to the corporations and gangs terrorizing the local community where the NCPD would or could not. What its founding fathers intended 6th Street to be is no more, however. Now they run Santo Domingo and they’re just as self serving and self-righteous about it as the rest of the worst out there in Night City.

The 6th Street gang is founded by veterans of the 4th Corporate War who is tired of the helplessness of the NPCD. 6th Street was supposed to protect the community of Visa Del Ray. But nowadays, their idea of "serving justice to the city" is highly questionable and somehow, self-serving.
- Estimated Gang Size: 2,300
- Turf: West Heywood


### Valentinos

![Valentinos logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zer0db/cnc-lore/refs/heads/main/factions/images/valentinos.png)
> Loyalty, family, and having each-others’ backs are at the core of the Valentinos credo. The streets of Heywood are their haven, decorated with colorful murals and shrines devoted to their idol, Santa Muerte, as well as being the venue for full-throttle drag races and all-night street parties. They know how to have fun, but cause trouble on their turf and you’ll have a whole lot of barrio to answer to.

Considered as Night City's largest gangs who has control over swathes of Latino sections of Heywood. The Valentinos are bound by a powerful moral code and treat values such as honor, justice, and brotherhood seriously.
- Estimated Gang Size: 6,000
- Turf: East Heywood


### Voodoo Boys

![Voodoo Boys logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zer0db/cnc-lore/refs/heads/main/factions/images/voodooboys.png)
> No-one else in Night City is so closely intertwined with the depths of Cyberspace than the Voodoo Boys. Rooted in Haitian culture and tradition, these elite netrunners use their mastery of the digital realm to hack data and information that would otherwise be untouchable. Operating out of Pacifica, they’re your go-to for access beyond Blackwall, but watch your back; they’re especially wary of strangers.

The Voodoo Boys come from the Pacifica and they are netrunners that are devoted to revealing the secrets of the Old Net and what seems to be behind the Blackwall. This gang breaks every single rule that they'll encounter and infiltrate neural networks by programming viruses.
- Estimated Gang Size: Unknown
- Turf: West Pacifica & Cyberspace


### Maelstrom

![Maelstrom logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zer0db/cnc-lore/refs/heads/main/factions/images/maelstrom.png)
> Dying to become more machine than man, consequences be damned, members of the Maelstrom gang implant their bodies to the extreme with powerful and highly illegal cyberware. Smuggling, hit-jobs, and high-stakes heists are the name of their game and they’re ruthlessly good at it. If you don't want their blood-red mechanical eyes to be the last thing you see, better play by their rules, and show some respect.

Maelstrom is a combat-oriented gang that has a large amount of cyber-modified members. They are obsessed with body modification beyond any standard on their way to becoming machines. A majority of their members are Cyberpsychos due to being over-cybered.
- Estimated Gang Size: 1,300
- Turf: East Pacifica


### Tyger Claws

![Tyger Claws logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zer0db/cnc-lore/refs/heads/main/factions/images/tygerclaws.png)
> Japantown is Tyger Claws’ main territory. No question. From illicit entertainment embedded deep in the red light district, to wholly legitimate services on the surface, these tattooed, katana-wielding gangsters know how to squeeze cash from over-stimulated pleasure seekers looking for a ‘good time’. Try to defy them, though, and you’ll lose more than just money.

The Tyger Claws, a clan of Japanese origin, is influenced by style and is intimidating in appearance. This ruthless gang who practices violence is located in Japantown. Katanas, street bikes, and lustrous tattoos are their trademarks.
- Estimated Gang Size: 5,500
- Turf: Westbrook


### Moxes

![Moxes logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zer0db/cnc-lore/refs/heads/main/factions/images/moxes.png)
> The Mox isn’t as big or as territorial as other gangs, but they are a force. Run by sex workers, punks, anarchists and sexual minorities inspired by the ways of the late stripper-turned-strip-club-owner Elizabeth "Lizzie" Borden, they shield their own from violence and abuse. Make no mistake, however - they are no saints. Their brand of protection is neither bloodless nor free, nor is it devoid of its own share of shady dealings.

The Moxes were formed in 2067 after the death of Elizabeth "Lizzie" Borden, a strip club owner who defended them from violent clients. The Mox refer to themselves as "those who protect working girls and guys" from violence and abuse.
- Estimated Gang Size: 200 - 250
- Turf: None; find them in Westbrook, around Lizzie's Bar

## Nomad Families

Nomads were once corporate wage-slaves, who got fired and blackballed from employment, and now they roam the highways as travellers and motor-gangs. As life on the road is hard, they maintain strong family bonds. If a Nomad is in trouble, he can count on members of his family to watch his back. 

### Aldecaldos

![Aldecaldos logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zer0db/cnc-lore/refs/heads/main/factions/images/aldecaldos.png)
> When gang violence claimed the life of Juan Aldecaldo’s son, the grieving father’s impassioned protests became a beacon for many outraged migrants in Los Angeles. They formed a family around him, and split away, taking to the road and adopting the nomad lifestyle. Elder Aldecaldo passed on in later years, and now the Aldecaldos find themselves camped in the deserts near Night City. Their RVs-cum mobile-workshops, souped-up-cars, and their proficiency for covert scavenging have allowed them to carve a life on the outskirts of the city, where they transport and smuggle goods for whoever is willing to pay.

The Aldelcaldos, the first true Nomad Family that was established in 1990s as Los Angeles turned into a war zone. 
- Estimated Gang Size: 500 - 600 in Night City.
- Turf: Outskirts of Night City

### Wraiths

![Wraiths logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zer0db/cnc-lore/refs/heads/main/factions/images/wraiths.png)
> Wraiths are a motley crew of those exiled from other nomad groups for violating customs, and for other transgressions. While most nomad families live on the edge of the law, Wraiths plant themselves firmly outside of it, eschewing the ‘folksy warmth’ aesthetic familiar to true nomad groups. They raid convoys with modded guns and missile launchers, adorn themselves in black and blue shades, evoking ethereal, ghostly imagery, and while to city dwellers they’re just another nomadic tribe, Wraiths are more akin to outright mercs—who just happen to share nomadic roots.

The Wraiths is one of the distinguished gangs of the Nomad groups who inhabit the badlands. This gang has a long history of frequent conflict and warring with the Aldecaldos, what sets them apart is that they travel mostly at night and prey on their foes while they are sleeping and unaware.
- Estimated Gang Size: 300 - 1200
- Turf: Outskirts of Night City
