## 6th Street

![6th Street logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zer0db/cnc-lore/refs/heads/main/factions/images/6street.png)
> 6th Street started out as the good guys; a force that would stand up to the corporations and gangs terrorizing the local community where the NCPD would or could not. What its founding fathers intended 6th Street to be is no more, however. Now they run Santo Domingo and they’re just as self serving and self-righteous about it as the rest of the worst out there in Night City.

The 6th Street gang is founded by veterans of the 4th Corporate War who is tired of the helplessness of the NPCD. 6th Street was supposed to protect the community of Visa Del Ray. But nowadays, their idea of "serving justice to the city" is highly questionable and somehow, self-serving.
- Estimated Gang Size: 2,300
- Turf: West Heywood


## Valentinos

> Loyalty, family, and having each-others’ backs are at the core of the Valentinos credo. The streets of Heywood are their haven, decorated with colorful murals and shrines devoted to their idol, Santa Muerte, as well as being the venue for full-throttle drag races and all-night street parties. They know how to have fun, but cause trouble on their turf and you’ll have a whole lot of barrio to answer to.

Considered as Night City's largest gangs who has control over swathes of Latino sections of Heywood. The Valentinos are bound by a powerful moral code and treat values such as honor, justice, and brotherhood seriously.

> No-one else in Night City is so closely intertwined with the depths of Cyberspace than the Voodoo Boys. Rooted in Haitian culture and tradition, these elite netrunners use their mastery of the digital realm to hack data and information that would otherwise be untouchable. Operating out of Pacifica, they’re your go-to for access beyond Blackwall, but watch your back; they’re especially wary of strangers.

The Voodoo Boys come from the Pacifica and they are netrunners that are devoted to revealing the secrets of the Old Net and what seems to be behind the Blackwall. This gang breaks every single rule that they'll encounter and infiltrate neural networks by programming viruses.

> Dying to become more machine than man, consequences be damned, members of the Maelstrom gang implant their bodies to the extreme with powerful and highly illegal cyberware. Smuggling, hit-jobs, and high-stakes heists are the name of their game and they’re ruthlessly good at it. If you don't want their blood-red mechanical eyes to be the last thing you see, better play by their rules, and show some respect.

Maelstrom is a combat-oriented gang that has a large amount of cyber-modified members. They are obsessed with body modification beyond any standard on their way to becoming machines. A majority of their members are Cyberpsychos due to being over-cybered.

> Japantown is Tyger Claws’ main territory. No question. From illicit entertainment embedded deep in the red light district, to wholly legitimate services on the surface, these tattooed, katana-wielding gangsters know how to squeeze cash from over-stimulated pleasure seekers looking for a ‘good time’. Try to defy them, though, and you’ll lose more than just money.

The Tyger Claws, a clan of Japanese origin, is influenced by style and is intimidating in appearance. This ruthless gang who practices violence is located in Japantown. Katanas, street bikes, and lustrous tattoos are their trademarks.

## Moxes

> The Mox isn’t as big or as territorial as other gangs, but they are a force. Run by sex workers, punks, anarchists and sexual minorities inspired by the ways of the late stripper-turned-strip-club-owner Elizabeth "Lizzie" Borden, they shield their own from violence and abuse. Make no mistake, however - they are no saints. Their brand of protection is neither bloodless nor free, nor is it devoid of its own share of shady dealings.

The Moxes were formed in 2067 after the death of Elizabeth "Lizzie" Borden, a strip club owner who defended them from violent clients. The Mox refer to themselves as "those who protect working girls and guys" from violence and abuse.
- Estimated Gang Size: 200 - 250
- Turf: None; find them in Westbrook, around Lizzie's Bar
